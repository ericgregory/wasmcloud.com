The wasmCloud host supports pulling OCI artifacts for [components](/docs/concepts/components) and [providers](/docs/concepts/providers) from [OCI](https://opencontainers.org/) (Open Container Initiative) registries. These artifacts are not container images, but conform to OCI standards and may be stored on any OCI-compatible registry. See the [Packaging](/docs/concepts/packaging.mdx) page for more details on how the wasmCloud ecosystem uses OCI artifacts for packaging.

## Allowing insecure access to a registry

By default wasmCloud will pull all images from a registry over HTTPS. If you need to pull images from a registry that does not have a valid certificate, you can allow wasmCloud to pull images from that registry by setting the `WASMCLOUD_OCI_ALLOWED_INSECURE` environment variable. For example:

```shell
export WASMCLOUD_OCI_ALLOWED_INSECURE='myregistry.example.com'
wash up
```
You may also include multiple registries in a comma-separated list.

## Configuring access to a private registry

In production environments, it's common to pull artifacts from a private registry. wasmCloud hosts can configured to authenticate with a private registry using [host configuration](/docs/cli/wasmcloud). For example, the following environment variables can be used to authenticate to the registry specified with the `WASMCLOUD_OCI_REGISTRY` option:

```shell
export WASMCLOUD_OCI_REGISTRY_USER='myuser'
export WASMCLOUD_OCI_REGISTRY_PASSWORD='myp4$$w0rd'
wash up
```

## Working with multiple registries

Sometimes it's necessary to pull artifacts from multiple private registries. In this case, a [config service](/docs/deployment/hosts/config-service) can be used to provide supplemental configuration, including credentials for multiple OCI registries.
