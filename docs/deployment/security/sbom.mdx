# Securing your wasmCloud supply chain with SBOMs

[**Software Bills of Materials (SBOMs)**](https://www.cisa.gov/sbom) describe the set of software dependencies (sometimes called the "software supply chain") used to build an application. 

The U.S. National Institute of Science and Technology (NIST) recommends that organizations utilize SBOMs to mitigate and swiftly remediate [software supply chain attacks](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/defending_against_software_supply_chain_attacks_508.pdf), and enterprises are increasingly adopting SBOMs as part of their security frameworks. 

WebAssembly modules and components have the intrinsic advantage of bringing nothing else except for the direct dependencies needed for building the application itself, and generating an SBOM for a wasmCloud application is a straightforward process using standard tooling from the cloud native ecosystem.

This document outlines the tooling and steps necessary to build and verify SBOMs for wasmCloud applications.

### Prerequisites

In addition to the wasmCloud tooling (`wash`) and language-specific tooling described in the [wasmCloud Quickstart](/docs/tour/hello-world?lang=tinygo), you will need the following tools:

* [`syft`](https://github.com/anchore/syft?tab=readme-ov-file#installation) for SBOM generation
* [`grype`](https://github.com/anchore/grype?tab=readme-ov-file#installation) for scanning the SBOM

### Example: Generating an SBOM

For this example, we'll use the "Hello world" template (in the language of your choice):

Create a new component:

```shell
wash new component hello
```
`wash` will list a set of templates to use as the basis for your project. 

```shell
? Select a project template: ›
  hello-world-rust: a hello-world component (in Rust) that responds over an HTTP connection
  hello-world-tinygo: a hello-world component (in TinyGo) that responds over an HTTP connection
  hello-world-typescript: a hello-world component (in TypeScript) that responds over an HTTP connection
```
**Use the arrow keys and press return** to select one of the options above, corresponding to your language. 

After a moment, `wash` will create a new directory called `hello` with all of the required project files for building a component from your chosen language. 

Navigate to the `hello` project directory:

```shell
cd hello
```
Running the `wash build` command will update your local dependencies (in addition to compiling a component):

```shell
wash build
```

To generate SBOM for your application, run: 

```shell
syft scan dir:. --output spdx-json=sbom.spdx.json
```

This will output a file called `sbom.spdx.json` in your project directory. 

To scan your SBOM for vulnerabilities, run:

```shell
grype sbom.spdx.json
```

Grype will compare the dependencies listed in your SBOM against the tool's vulnerability database. The output should look like this:

```text
 ✔ Vulnerability DB                [updated]  
 ✔ Scanned for vulnerabilities     [0 vulnerability matches]  
   ├── by severity: 0 critical, 0 high, 0 medium, 0 low, 0 negligible
   └── by status:   0 fixed, 0 not-fixed, 0 ignored 
No vulnerabilities found
```
