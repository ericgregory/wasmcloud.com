## Overview

This deployment guide demonstrates how to deploy wasmCloud to a Kubernetes cluster using Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), and then run wasmCloud applications built from WebAssembly components. 

To follow this guide, you will need an account for [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).

## Deploy an AKS cluster

Before you get started, you will need an AKS cluster. The Azure documentation includes instructions for creating an AKS cluster via [Mac/Linux CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-cli), [PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-powershell), or the [Azure web portal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-portal). 

## Set up your CLI tools

This guide uses **`kubectl`**, **Helm**, and the **wasmCloud Shell (`wash`)** CLI. 

### Install `kubectl`

Install the `kubectl` CLI for Kubernetes cluster management. 

On macOS, you can use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):

```shell
brew install kubernetes-cli
```
On Linux systems, you can use `curl` to download the latest release:

```shell
curl -LO https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/$(curl -s https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/stable.txt)/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl
```
Use `chmod` to make the `kubectl` binary executable:

```shell
chmod +x ./kubectl
```
Add the binary to your PATH:

```shell
sudo mv ./kubectl /usr/local/bin/kubectl
```

### Install Helm

[Helm](https://helm.sh/) serves as a package manager for Kubernetes. Follow the instructions on the [Helm install page](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) or use the project's install script:

```shell
curl -fsSL -o get_helm.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helm/helm/main/scripts/get-helm-3
chmod 700 get_helm.sh
./get_helm.sh
```

### Install wash

Once wasmCloud is deployed to your AKS cluster, you can use the **wasmCloud Shell (`wash`)** CLI to manage wasmCloud applications. If you do not have `wash` installed locally, follow the instructions on the [install page](https://wasmcloud.com/docs/installation).


## Deploying wasmCloud

In order to deploy wasmCloud, we will install the `wasmcloud-platform` Helm chart. By default, the chart installs NATS, `wadm`, and the wasmCloud operator subchart. 

```shell
helm upgrade --install \
    wasmcloud-platform \
    --values https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wasmCloud/wasmcloud/main/charts/wasmcloud-platform/values.yaml \
    oci://ghcr.io/wasmcloud/charts/wasmcloud-platform:0.1.2 \
    --dependency-update
```

Wait for all components to install and `wadm-nats` communications to establish:

```shell
kubectl rollout status deploy,sts -l app.kubernetes.io/name=nats
```
```shell
kubectl wait --for=condition=available --timeout=600s deploy -l app.kubernetes.io/name=wadm
```
```shell
kubectl wait --for=condition=available --timeout=600s deploy -l app.kubernetes.io/name=wasmcloud-operator
```

Next create a wasmCloud host:

```shell
helm upgrade --install wasmcloud-platform \
  --values https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wasmCloud/wasmcloud/main/charts/wasmcloud-platform/values.yaml \
  oci://ghcr.io/wasmcloud/charts/wasmcloud-platform \
  --dependency-update \
  --set "hostConfig.enabled=true"
```

If the deployment is successful, you should receive the note:

```shell
‚ú® Congratulations! Your wasmCloud platform has been deployed successfully.
   - üõÄ To use the wash cli with your new wasmCloud platform, run:
    kubectl port-forward service/nats 4222:4222 4223:4223

   - üó∫Ô∏è  To launch the wasmCloud dashboard on http://localhost:3030, in a different terminal window, run:
     wash ui
```

If you'd like, you can check wasmCloud host status:

```shell
kubectl describe wasmcloudhostconfig wasmcloud-host
```

## Run a WebAssembly component on Kubernetes

When you `kubectl apply` a [wasmCloud application manifest](/docs/ecosystem/wadm/model), the cluster automatically provisions the component workload with wasmCloud. 

This example uses the [`hello-world-application.yaml` manifest](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wasmCloud/wasmcloud-operator/main/examples/quickstart/hello-world-application.yaml) included in the operator's quickstart. (The [source code for the application](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmCloud/tree/main/examples/rust/components/http-hello-world) is available in the wasmCloud repository.)

Below is an excerpt of the manifest:

```yaml {7-7}
...
spec:
  components:
    - name: http-component
      type: component
      properties:
        image: ghcr.io/wasmcloud/components/http-hello-world-rust:0.1.0
...
```
The component is packaged as an OCI artifact and specified in the `image` field. This isn't a container, but a component conforming to OCI standards, meaning that it can be used with existing registries for container images. 

Run `kubectl apply`: 

```shell
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wasmCloud/wasmcloud-operator/main/examples/quickstart/hello-world-application.yaml
```

Check the deployment status:

```shell
kubectl get application
```

```shell
APPLICATION   DEPLOYED VERSION   LATEST VERSION   STATUS
hello-world   v0.0.1             v0.0.1           Deployed
```

When you run a wasmCloud application that uses the `httpserver` provider with a daemonscaler, as this one does, the operator automatically creates a Kubernetes service for the application. 

:::warning[HTTP Server Address]
When you're using the HTTP Server provider in an application that will run on Kubernetes with the wasmCloud operator, make sure the application manifest configures the provider to use the address `0.0.0.0`, for example:

```yaml {15-15}
- name: httpserver
  type: capability
  properties:
    image: ghcr.io/wasmcloud/http-server:0.26.0
  traits:
    - type: link
      properties:
        target: http-component
        namespace: wasi
        package: http
        interfaces: [incoming-handler]
        source_config:
          - name: default-http
            properties:
              address: 0.0.0.0:8000
```

Because of the way the application runs within a wasmCloud host pod, using `127.0.0.1` results in networking errors when running on Kubernetes.

View services:

```shell
kubectl get services
```
```text
NAME                 TYPE        CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)                                        AGE

wasmcloud-operator   ClusterIP   10.96.73.87      <none>        8443/TCP                                       7m54s

```

### Test the application

On a cluster without ingress (such as this one), you can still test the component from within the wasmCloud host container where the application is running. 

Assign the wasmCloud host pod name to an environment variable:

```shell
WASMCLOUD_HOST_POD=$(kubectl get pods -o jsonpath="{.items[*].metadata.name}" -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=wasmcloud-host)
```
Port-forward the wasmCloud host's port 8000:

```shell
kubectl port-forward pods/$WASMCLOUD_HOST_POD 8000
```
`curl` the application:

```shell
curl http://localhost:8000
```

You should get the response:

```plaintext
Hello from Rust!
```

### Debugging

You can use `kubectl` to get logs from the wasmCloud host running on your cluster:

```shell
kubectl logs -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=wasmcloud-host -c wasmcloud-host
```

You can use a debug pod to test connections to an HTTP application's service from within the cluster:

```shell
kubectl run -i --tty --rm debug --image=curlimages/curl --restart=Never -- sh
```

Once the command prompt appears, you can try running `curl` against the service name and port of your application. For the `hello-world` application in the guide above, this would look like:

```shell
curl hello-world:8000
```

### Common mistakes

* If you're having trouble deploying an application, make sure your wadm application manifest references an OCI image and not a local file.
* If a service is not automatically generated for an application using the httpserver provider, check to ensure that the provider uses `daemonscaler` in the application manifest. (You can see an example of this in the [`hello-world-application` manifest](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wasmCloud/wasmcloud-operator/main/examples/quickstart/hello-world-application.yaml).)
* If you're having trouble connecting to an application that uses the HTTP Server provider, make sure it is configured to use the address `0.0.0.0`. 

### Manage applications with `wash`

Connect your local `wash` with the wasmCloud deployment. `4222` is the port for the NATS service and `4223` is the port for NATS websockets.

```shell
kubectl port-forward service/nats 4222:4222 4223:4223
```

Now you can use your local `wash` toolchain with your wasmCloud deployment:

```shell
wash get inventory
```
The output should look like this:

```plaintext
  Host labels                                                                     
  hostcore.arch                 aarch64

  Provider ID                   Name                                              
  hello_world-httpserver        http-server-provider   
```

## Clean up

Delete the `hello-world` application:

```shell
kubectl delete -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wasmCloud/wasmcloud-operator/main/examples/quickstart/hello-world-application.yaml
```

Delete the wasmCloud host and associated resources:

```shell
kubectl delete -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wasmCloud/wasmcloud-operator/main/examples/quickstart/wasmcloud-host.yaml
```

All resources installed via Helm can be removed with [`helm uninstall`](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_uninstall/):

```shell
helm uninstall wasmcloud-platform
```

Follow the instructions from the AKS documentation to [delete your cluster and nodes](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/delete-cluster?tabs=azure-cli). If you set up an AKS cluster with the AKS CLI via the [AKS quickstart](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-cli), the command would look like this:

```shell
az aks delete --name $MY_AKS_CLUSTER_NAME --resource-group $MY_RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME
```
