This section describes how you can iteratively build and test your component functionality.

## wash dev

`wash dev` starts a local wasmCloud environment (if you don't already have one started), builds your component,
and automatically registers your component with the host. It will also watch your component source code for
changes, recompile, and update the component in the host.

This is a great way to get started with wasmCloud development, and we recommend it for all new
components.

```bash
wash dev
```

The output should look like the following:

```bash
âœ… Successfully started host, logs writing to /home/.wash/dev/kSKCGi/wasmcloud.log
ðŸš§ Building project...
...
âœ¨ HTTP Server: Access your application at http://127.0.0.1:8000
ðŸ‘€ Watching for file changes (press Ctrl+c to stop)...
```

This will watch your project's files and, whenever there's a change, recompile and update the component in the host. Try iterating through a few changes in the [Add Features](/docs/tour/add-features) section to see how it works.

If a component is handling a message when an update occurs, the host waits for the message handler to complete, then swaps in the newer WebAssembly component before the next message is processed.
