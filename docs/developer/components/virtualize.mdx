In the course of developing some components, you may find that you need to be able to **virtualize** a component within another encapsulating component in order to abstract away certain requirements. For example, the component may use an import not available from either the host or another entity on the lattice. One common reason for this scenario is that a required import is not secure. Virtualization provides an additional layer of sandboxing.

In conventional usage, components utilizing WASI APIs such as Sockets and Filesystem have access to core operating system interfaces. In order to run such APIs securely on wasmCloud, it is necessary to isolate the component with [**WASI Virt**](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasi-virt).

WASI Virt is a [Bytecode Alliance](https://bytecodealliance.org/) project that enables encapsulation of a virtualized component within another component. WASI API usage is deny-by-default for virtualized components&mdash;interfaces must be explicitly enabled at the time of composition. WASI Virt supports the following WASI APIs:

* Clocks
* Environment
* Exit
* Filesystem
* HTTP
* Random
* Sockets
* Stdio

WASI Virt's virtual adapters are implemented with Wasm, providing complete isolation between the application and virtualization layers. Because WASI Virt and wasmCloud use the common standards of the Component Model and WASI P2, components generated with WASI Virt may be deployed directly to wasmCloud.

## Install WASI Virt

WASI Virt requires [Rust and Cargo](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

Install the `wasi-virt` command line tool with Rust's `cargo` package manager:

```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasi-virt
```

## Example: Virtualized environment variables

In this example, we'll use WASI Virt to virtualize a component that uses **environment variables** within an encapsulating component.

In addition to WASI Virt, you will need [wasmCloud Shell (wash)](https://wasmcloud.com/docs/installation).

The example files are included in the wasmCloud [monorepo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monorepo) at [github.com/wasmcloud/wasmcloud](https://github.com/wasmcloud/wasmcloud). You can perform a "sparse" checkout to download only the relevant example directory (and associated documentation and metadata):

```bash
git clone --depth 1 --no-checkout https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmCloud.git
cd wasmcloud
git sparse-checkout set ./examples/rust/composition
git checkout
cd examples/rust/composition
```

For this example, we will use only the `pong` and `http-hello2` directories.

### Virtualizing a component

Navigate to the `pong` directory. Here we have a Rust-based component with a custom interface called `pong` that will return a string "ping" on its exported `pingpong` interface. Build the component:

```shell
cd pong
wash build
```

We can use `wash inspect` to take a look at the WIT for this component:

```shell
wash inspect --wit ./build/pong_s.wasm
```
```wit
package root:component;

world root {
  import wasi:cli/environment@0.2.1;
  import wasi:cli/exit@0.2.0;
  import wasi:io/error@0.2.0;
  import wasi:io/streams@0.2.0;
  import wasi:cli/stdin@0.2.0;
  import wasi:cli/stdout@0.2.0;
  import wasi:cli/stderr@0.2.0;
  import wasi:clocks/wall-clock@0.2.0;
  import wasi:filesystem/types@0.2.0;
  import wasi:filesystem/preopens@0.2.0;
  import wasi:random/random@0.2.0;

  export example:pong/pingpong;
}
```
You can see the `pingpong` interface listed as an export and `wasi:cli/environment` as one of many imports. 

Using WASI Virt, we can compose `pong_s.wasm` into an encapsulating component with an environment variable `PONG` set to `demo`. The resulting component will be named `virt.wasm`.

```shell
wasi-virt build/pong_s.wasm --allow-random -e PONG=demo -o virt.wasm
```
In this command...

* We define the input component, `build/pong_s.wasm`
* We use `--allow-random` to allow the virtualized component to import `wasi:random/random`, because we know the wasmCloud host can satisfy that requirement
* We set an environment variable `PONG` to `demo` using the `-e` flag
* We name the output component `virt.wasm`

Now let's view the WIT for our virtualized component:

```shell
wash inspect --wit virt.wasm 
```
```wit
package root:component;

world root {
  import wasi:cli/exit@0.2.0;
  import wasi:io/error@0.2.0;
  import wasi:io/streams@0.2.0;
  import wasi:cli/stdin@0.2.0;
  import wasi:cli/stdout@0.2.0;
  import wasi:cli/stderr@0.2.0;
  import wasi:clocks/wall-clock@0.2.0;
  import wasi:filesystem/types@0.2.0;
  import wasi:filesystem/preopens@0.2.0;
  import wasi:random/random@0.2.0;

  export example:pong/pingpong;
}
```
The virtualized component still exports `pingpong` but no longer requires `wasi:cli/environment`&mdash;that import is satisfied by the encapsulating component. If we run this component on wasmCloud, the host will be able to satisfy the other imports&mdash;it will simply require another component to invoke it via the `pingpong` interface. 

In the `http-hello2` directory, we have a modified `http-hello-world` component that imports the `pingpong` interface and calls for a string from `pong` to append to the hello world message. Let's navigate over to that directory and build the component.

```shell
cd ../http-hello2
wash build
```
The `wadm.yaml` deployment manifest in this directory will launch both the virtualized `pong` component and the new `http-hello-world` we just built. When we deploy with this manifest, wasmCloud will automatically [**link the components at runtime**](/docs/concepts/linking-components/linking-at-runtime.mdx), so that `pong` can satisfy the import of `http-hello-world`. 

```shell
wash app deploy wadm.yaml
```

When we invoke `http-hello-world` via `curl`, it invokes `pong`:

```shell
curl localhost:8000
Hello World! I got pong demo
```

The environment variable value `demo` from our virtualization is returned in the hello world message. 

## Troubleshooting

If `wasi-virt` returns an error such as `no dependencies of component `build/pong_s.wasm` were found`, WASI Virt may have been updated to use a more recent version of `wasi:cli/environment` than the pong component. You can check the WIT used by WASI Virt [here](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/WASI-Virt/tree/main/wit/deps) and adjust the pong component's imports accordingly in `pong/wit/world.wit`.  

If you need to troubleshoot a component virtualization, you may find it useful to examine the WIT exports of the virtual "harness" component generated by WASI Virt. In order to generate a virtual harness alone, you can run a `wasi-virt` command without specifying a target component, for example:

```shell
wasi-virt --allow-random -e PONG=demo -o harness.wasm
```

As in the examples above, you can inspect the component's WIT with `wash inspect --wit harness.wasm`. At the time of this writing, this would produce a harness component where the WIT looks like this:

```wit
package root:component;

world root {
  export wasi:cli/environment@0.2.1;
  export wasi:config/store@0.2.0-draft;
  export wasi:cli/exit@0.2.1;
  export wasi:io/error@0.2.1;
  export wasi:io/poll@0.2.1;
  export wasi:io/streams@0.2.1;
  export wasi:clocks/monotonic-clock@0.2.1;
  export wasi:clocks/wall-clock@0.2.1;
  export wasi:sockets/network@0.2.1;
  export wasi:sockets/ip-name-lookup@0.2.1;
  export wasi:sockets/tcp@0.2.1;
  export wasi:sockets/udp@0.2.1;
  export wasi:sockets/instance-network@0.2.1;
  export wasi:sockets/tcp-create-socket@0.2.1;
  export wasi:sockets/udp-create-socket@0.2.1;
  export wasi:http/types@0.2.1;
  export wasi:http/incoming-handler@0.2.1;
  export wasi:http/outgoing-handler@0.2.1;
  export wasi:cli/stdin@0.2.1;
  export wasi:cli/stdout@0.2.1;
  export wasi:cli/stderr@0.2.1;
  export wasi:cli/terminal-input@0.2.1;
  export wasi:cli/terminal-output@0.2.1;
  export wasi:cli/terminal-stdin@0.2.1;
  export wasi:cli/terminal-stdout@0.2.1;
  export wasi:cli/terminal-stderr@0.2.1;
  export wasi:filesystem/types@0.2.1;
  export wasi:filesystem/preopens@0.2.1;
}
```

If you produce a standalone harness component, you can manually compose it with another component using the [**WebAssembly Compositions (WAC) CLI**](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wac). For example:

```shell
wac plug build/pong_s.wasm --plug harness.wasm -o composed.wasm
```
