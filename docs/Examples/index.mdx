title: "Examples"
---

This section includes examples of [WebAssembly components](/docs/concepts/components.mdx) and [capability providers](/docs/concepts/providers.mdx) for wasmCloud. Examples are organized by programming language, and then by type: component or provider.

:::warning[Under construction]
We are in the process of automating the propagation of examples from [wasmCloud repositories on GitHub](https://github.com/wasmCloud/) to this documentation. Examples in **Go** currently propagate from the [`wasmCloud/go` repo](https://github.com/wasmCloud/go).

You can find additional examples in other languages such as Rust, TypeScript, and more in the [`wasmCloud`](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmCloud/tree/main/examples), [`wasmCloud/typescript`](https://github.com/wasmCloud/typescript), and [`wasmCloud/contrib`](https://github.com/wasmcloud/contrib) repositories.
