## Agenda

{/* Update before the start of the meeting with planned agenda items */}

- [OpenAPI to MCP `wash` plugin](https://github.com/cosmonic-labs/openapi2mcp)
- Wasm and JavaScript/TypeScript

{/* truncate */}

## Meeting Notes

{/* Add summary of topics during the meeting. Each Topic should have an H3 heading. A list is usually sufficient for the recap */}

### MCP Server Demo

* A demo shows how to create an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server as a Wasm component using a TypeScript template. 
* This server can make HTTP requests to an API and teach LLMs (Large Language Models) how to interact with it, acting as a "glue" between LLMs and backend services.

### OpenAPI to MCP

* A new `wash` plugin called "OpenAPI to MCP" is demonstrated. This plugin takes an OpenAPI specification document and generates MCP tools from it, streamlining the process of creating an MCP server.

### WebAssembly and JavaScript/TypeScript 

* Discussion of how the project allows developers to write idiomatic TypeScript/JavaScript code that compiles into WebAssembly components, making them portable and sandboxed while being much smaller than traditional containers.
* Victor explains StarlingMonkey, a JavaScript runtime that compiles to WebAssembly, enabling JavaScript code to run efficiently in WebAssembly modules.
* The future roadmap involves supporting more general Node.js APIs within StarlingMonkey and optimizing WebAssembly components to share common runtimes, leading to even smaller binaries.

### Q3 Roadmap and Q4 Planning

* Updates on the Q3 roadmap progress are given, particularly regarding the integration of the runtime crate into wash, and planning for the Q4 roadmap is set for two weeks later.
