## Meeting Notes

* Todayâ€™s meeting is a special livestream from KubeCon!
* Speaking at the Project Pavilion at KubeCon NA 2024, Brooks notes that wasmCloud is now Incubating at the CNCF and introduces the fundamentals of the project: Wasm-native orchestration and building Wasm components with capabilities.
* In his demonstration of `wash dev`, Brooks shows how to begin a development loop, build a new component, and swap out capabilities, illustrating wasmCloud's deny-by-default design for capabilities.
* For those in the audience new to WebAssembly and wasmCloud, Brooks also discusses the contrast between swappable capability providers and abstraction from dependencies in wasmCloud with similar ideas in infrastructure-as-code. 
* In wasmCloud, there's no need to inspect actual code&mdash;the same Wasm binary that you're deploying encodes all the information you need about its requirements.
* This is exactly how `wash dev` is able to satisfy common capability requirements automatically in your developer loop&mdash;the process can inspect your requirements and then choose appropriate providers to satisfy them.
* For many of those in the live audience at KubeCon, this is your first wasmCloud community meeting&mdash;we hope to see you again soon! You can also join us on the [wasmCloud Slack](https://slack.wasmcloud.com/)!
