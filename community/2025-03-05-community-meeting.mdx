## Meeting Notes

{/* Add summary of topics during the meeting. Each Topic should have an H3 heading. A list is usually sufficient for the recap */}

### Update on `wash-cli` and `wash-lib` consolidation

- [Ahmed](https://github.com/ahmedtadde) has been working on merging `wash-lib` and `wash-cli`. By consolidating those, we’ll be able to release features a lot quicker. 
- [This PR](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmCloud/pull/4047) is underway and we’re going to continue declining to merge anything into `wash-lib` or `wash-cli` until this lands. 
- Right before the PR lands, we’ll cut one last release of `wash-lib` and `wash-cli`, and then we’ll have a singular wash crate under wasmCloud.
- This shouldn’t change anything for anyone installing wash except for those installing through `cargo`&mdash;you’ll use `wash` instead of `wash-cli`.

### Update on provenance and attestation work

- [Masoud](https://github.com/ossfellow) updated the community on his progress on provenance and attestation.
- Masoud has revised the approach, providing the background in [this comment](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmCloud/issues/3975#issuecomment-2689614607).
- His latest work can be found [here](https://github.com/ossfellow/dugout/tree/main/.github).
- [This comment](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmCloud/issues/3975#issuecomment-2689614607) includes observations on possible challenges in the build pipeline (at the bottom of the comment) for further discussion.
