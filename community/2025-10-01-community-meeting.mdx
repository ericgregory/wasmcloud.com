## Meeting Notes

### GitHub Actions Toolkit 

* A new [GitHub Actions toolkit](https://github.com/wasmCloud/actions/tree/main) has been released, allowing for easier setup and installation of `wash`. 
* This toolkit now supports installing and attesting from binary versions of `wash`, with built-in attestation for security. 
* It also includes a "publish" action that can be integrated into existing workflows, and a "wash build" action for language-agnostic artifact path identification.

### `wash` non-interactive mode

* A non-interactive mode has been added to `wash` to handle privileged operations in CI environments where user prompts are not possible.

### Volume mounts for `wash` plugins

* The team is working on introducing volume mounts for `wash` plugins, similar to the concept in the next version of the host and workload spec. 
* This aims to provide more flexible file system interaction for plugins, moving away from copying scratch results.
