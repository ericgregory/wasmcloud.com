## Meeting Notes

{/* Add summary of topics during the meeting. Each Topic should have an H3 heading. A list is usually sufficient for the recap */}

### wasmCP (WebAssembly Component Development Kit) Demo

* Corey and Ian introduce wasmCP, a framework for building MCP (Model Context Protocol) tooling. 
* They demonstrate how to scaffold new tools (currently supporting Rust, Python, and TypeScript), add functionality (like addition, subtraction, square, square root), build and compose them using `wash`, and run them as an MCP server. 
* A key feature highlighted is the ability to build "middleware" or "composed tools" that can combine or abstract the functionality of other tools (e.g., a Pythagorean theorem tool calling square and square root tools). 
* They emphasize that developers only need to focus on business logic, and the framework handles MCP-related complexities. 
* The project aims to provide a first-class MCP SDK built on WebAssembly components, allowing dynamic composition of tools written in different languages.

### wasmCloud Services and Long-Running Components Demo 

* Brooks introduces the new "service" concept in wasmCloud. 
* Previously, wasmCloud components were short-lived and reactive. Services are now long-running components that target the Wasmtime CLI world, similar to a regular process. 
* A demo shows a "cron service" (a long-running component) invoking a "cron component" on a timed interval via a custom interface. 
* This new capability allows for proof-of-concept capability providers and extends custom functionality within the wasmCloud runtime, opening up use cases like long-lived database connections, custom metrics collectors, and more flexible application architectures.
