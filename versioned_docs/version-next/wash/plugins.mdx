# Wasm Shell Plugins

The Wasm Shell (`wash`) CLI is extensible via a component-driven plugin system. New integrations and functionality can be implemented across any language that compiles to a WebAssembly component target, and then the component can plug in directly to `wash`.

## First-party plugins

The following plugins are available from the wasmCloud project:

* `blobstore-filesystem`: Extends `wash dev` to support the `wasi:blobstore` interface backed by local filesystem. ([Source](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wash/tree/main/plugins/blobstore-filesystem) | [OCI](https://github.com/orgs/wasmCloud/packages/container/package/wash-plugins%2Fblobstore-filesystem))
* `aspire-otel`: Launches the Aspire dashboard. ([Source](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wash/tree/main/plugins/aspire-otel))

## Subcommands

The `wash plugin` command takes the following subcommands:

* `install` - Install a plugin from an OCI reference or file
* `uninstall` - Uninstall a plugin
* `list` - List installed plugins
* `test` - Test a plugin

### Install a plugin

Install a plugin from an OCI reference or file:

```shell
wash plugin install <SOURCE>
```

To install a plugin from an OCI reference, target the OCI artifact with `wash plugin intall`. For example, to install the `blobstore-filesystem` plugin:

```shell
wash plugin install ghcr.io/wasmcloud/wash-plugins/blobstore-filesystem:0.1.0
```

To install a plugin from source, build the component with `wash build` and then target the component binary with `wash plugin install`. For example, to build the `blobstore-filesystem` component from source:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/wasmCloud/wash.git
```
```shell
cd wash/plugins/blobstore-filesystem
```
```shell
wash build
```
```shell
wash plugin install ./target/wasm32-wasip2/release/blobstore_filesystem.wasm
```

See the command reference for [complete command options](./commands.mdx#wash-plugin-install).

### Uninstall a plugin

Uninstall a plugin by name:

```shell
wash plugin uninstall <NAME>
```

See the command reference for [complete command options](./commands.mdx#wash-plugin-uninstall).

### List installed plugins

List installed plugins:

```shell
wash plugin list
```

See the command reference for [complete command options](./commands.mdx#wash-plugin-list).

### Test a plugin

Test a plugin by filepath to the component or component project, and the argument you wish to pass to the plugin:

```shell
wash plugin test <PLUGIN> <ARG>
```

See the command reference for [complete command options](./commands.mdx#wash-plugin-test).

## Developing plugins

:::warning[Under rapid development]
The plugin model is under rapid development, and the `wasmcloud:wash/plugin` interface is subject to regular changes. Feedback on the interface is [welcome on the `wash` Issues page](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wash/issues).
:::

Wasm Shell plugins are standard component projects, with a `wit` directory and WIT world defining imports and exports. You can find examples in [the plugins subfolder on GitHub](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wash/tree/main/plugins).

Plugins export on the [`wasmcloud:wash/plugin` interface](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wash/blob/main/plugins/blobstore-filesystem/wit/deps/wasmcloud-wash-0.0.1/package.wit), and have access to the following WASI interfaces:

1. `wasi@0.2` core interfaces (`cli`, `filesystem`, `io`)
2. `wasi:http/incoming-handler`: Enables command plugins (see below) to support use-cases for components that can be interacted with over HTTP
4. `wasi:http/outgoing-handler`: To make outgoing HTTP requests
5. `wasi:config/runtime`: For configuration fetching
6. `wasi:logging/logging`: For structured/leveled output

`wash` plugins are integrated into multiple places in the lifecycle of the CLI:

### Hooks 

Plugins can run at various hook points before and after any built-in `wash` command:
1. `BeforeDev`: Before a `wash dev` session (e.g., Launch an OTEL dashboard for tracing/logging/metrics data)
2. `BeforePush`: Before an OCI push (e.g., Add an additional annotation onto the OCI artifact config)
3. `AfterBuild`: After a Wasm binary build (e.g., Use `cosign` to sign a component)
4. `AfterDev`: After a `wash dev` session (e.g., Inspect the built component and generate a deployment manifest for it)

### Commands

Plugins can also register top-level commands in `wash`, or register top-level commands with a list of subcommands. 

Command plugins are registered directly into the CLI parsing and appear just like built-in commands, but they execute as component plugins. For example, the `oauth` plugin launches an HTTP server on execution of the command. Command plugins do not have their own hooks.

You can see the hook and command flow in the diagram below:
