# Wasm Shell and OCI Registries

Wasm Shell enables component developers to push WebAssembly components to Open Container Initiative (OCI) registries as standard [**OCI artifacts**](https://oras.land/docs/concepts/artifact/), and to pull component artifacts from registries. 

OCI artifacts include a wide range of content types such as WebAssembly components, Software Bill of Materials (SBOMs), and Helm charts as well as container images.

### Authenticating to OCI registries

`wash` supports loading Docker credentials. There are multiple [ways to authenticate with Docker credentials](https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/login/), including the `docker login` command with the docker CLI:

```shell
docker login <registry> -u <username> -p <password-or-token> 
```

### How to push a WebAssembly component to an OCI registry

Push the component to your registry:

```shell
wash oci push ghcr.io/cosmonic-labs/components/hello:0.2.0 ./dist/http-hello-world.wasm
```

* The target registry address (including artifact name and tag) are specified for the first option with `wash oci push`.
* The second option defines the target path for the component binary to push.

### How to pull a WebAssembly component from an OCI registry

Pull the component from your registry:

```shell
wash oci pull ghcr.io/wasmcloud/components/http-hello-world-rust:0.1.0
```

### Further reading

* `wash` uses the `oras` client library (Rust) for OCI functionality. See the [`oras` documentation](https://oras.land/docs/) for more information.
