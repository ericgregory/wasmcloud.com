**Wasm Shell** (`wash`) is the comprehensive command-line tool for developing, building, and publishing WebAssembly components.

In this section of the Developer Guide, you'll learn how to:

* Compile your project to a WebAssembly component binary
* Publish your component to an OCI registry

:::info[Prerequisites]
If you haven't completed the previous section on installing `wash`, creating a project, and starting a developer loop, we recommend [starting there](./index.md).

## Building WebAssembly components

Use the `wash build` command from the root of a project directory to compile the component into a `.wasm` binary:

```shell
wash build
```

The output path for the compiled `.wasm` binary varies by language toolchain and [can be configured via `wash`'s `config.json` file](../config.mdx).

<Tabs groupId="lang" queryString>
  <TabItem value="rust" label="Rust" default>
  By default, the compiled `.wasm` binary for a Rust project is generated at `/target/wasm32-wasip2/debug/`.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="tinygo" label="TinyGo">
  By default, the compiled `.wasm` binary for a TinyGo project is generated at `/build/`.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="typescript" label="TypeScript">
  By default, the compiled `.wasm` binary for a TypeScript project is generated at `/dist/`.
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

You can find more options for the `wash build` command in the [Command Reference](../commands.mdx). 

### Interface dependencies and `wash build`

When you run `wash build`, `wash` reads the specified world in your WIT files and downloads the appropriate dependencies automatically into the `wit/deps` directory. As such, in most cases you should add `wit/deps` to your `.gitignore` file.

Without any additional configuration, `wash` can download dependencies from the following namespaces (i.e. the `wasi` in `wasi:http@0.2.1`):

- `wasi`: Interfaces proposed for the common [WebAssembly System Interface (WASI) standard](https://wasi.dev/)
- `wasmcloud`: Interfaces maintained as part of the wasmCloud project (see the [Capability Catalog](/docs/capabilities/) to find first-party interfaces)
- `wrpc`: [Interfaces](/docs/reference/wasi/wrpc-interfaces) maintained as part of the WIT-over-RPC (wRPC) project
- `ba`: Interfaces maintained by the [Bytecode Alliance](https://bytecodealliance.org/)

## Components and OCI registries

Once you're finished iterating on your component, you can publish it to any OCI compliant registry that supports **OCI artifacts**. These artifacts are not container images, but conform to OCI standards and may be stored on any OCI-compatible registry. 

### Authenticating to OCI registries

`wash` supports the usage of Docker credentials for authentication to registries. There are multiple [ways to authenticate with Docker credentials](https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/login/), including the `docker login` command with the `docker` CLI:

```shell
docker login <registry> -u <username> -p <password-or-token> 
```

### Publishing to OCI registries

Push the component to your registry:

```shell
wash oci push ghcr.io/<namespace>/hello:0.2.0 ./dist/http-hello-world.wasm
```

* The target registry address (including artifact name and tag) are specified for the first option with `wash oci push`.
* The second option defines the target path for the component binary to push.
