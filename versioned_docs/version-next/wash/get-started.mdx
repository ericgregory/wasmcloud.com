# Wasm Shell (wash) CLI

### **Wasm Shell** (`wash`) is the comprehensive command-line tool for developing, building, and publishing WebAssembly components. 

The CLI provides an intuitive developer experience for the modern Wasm ecosystem, from project scaffolding to building and pushing components to OCI registries.

The Wasm Shell CLI is [available on GitHub](https://github.com/wasmcloud/wash) as part of the open source [wasmCloud](https://github.com/wasmCloud) project, hosted by the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)](https://www.cncf.io/).

Pre-built binaries for macOS, Linux, and Windows are [available on GitHub](https://github.com/wasmcloud/wash/releases).

## What does `wash` do?

Check your environment for component development dependencies:

```shell
wash doctor
```

Create a new component project:

```shell
wash new
```

Start a component development loop:

```shell
wash dev
```

Build a component project into a WebAssembly binary:

```shell
wash build
```

Update `wash`:

```shell
wash update
```


## Next steps

* Explore the `wash` CLI's commands.
* Try the wasmCloud developer quickstart to create your first WebAssembly component.
* Build a more advanced component in the wasmCloud developer guide.
