![Good first issues for wasmCloud in Q3 2025](./images/blog-gfi-q3-2025.webp)

As the wasmCloud community digs into [our Q3 roadmap](/blog/2025-07-15-q3-2025-roadmap-recap/index.md), now is the perfect time to get involved with the project. Whether you're a veteran wasmCloud user or brand new to the Wasm ecosystem, there are tons of opportunities for folks of all experience levels to contribute. 

Ready to pitch in? Here are some of our current [good first issues](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmCloud/issues?q=state%3Aopen%20label%3A%22good%20first%20issue%22) for new contributors, drawn from across several repos:

* [`wasmCloud/wasmCloud`](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmCloud): The monorepo for all development on wasmCloud itself
* [`wasmCloud/wasmcloud.com`](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmcloud.com): The project website and documentation
* [`wasmCloud/go`](https://github.com/wasmCloud/go): wasmCloud Go ecosystem libraries and tooling
* [`wasmCloud/typescript`](https://github.com/wasmCloud/typescript): wasmCloud TypeScript ecosystem libraries and tooling

## `wasmCloud/wasmCloud`: Standardize image reference field names

Across the project, we use a variety of different names for image references, including but not limited to: 

* `provider_ref` 
* `image_ref` 
* `component_ref`

This issue proposes that we name these `image_reference` everywhere. Since we depend on the variously-named fields in other places, this effort will need to add a new field and deprecate the old ones. [See the issue for more information](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmCloud/issues/3909). 

## `wasmCloud/wasmcloud.com`: Implement reusable language tabs

Documentation is a great place to make a first contribution, and this is a good opportunity for someone with frontend experience.

In the wasmCloud documentation, we often need to present instructions on the same task across multiple languages, given the polyglot nature of Wasm development. We use `<Tabs>` and `<Tab>` components to organize content according to language, but this requires maintaining the same id everywhere the components are used. This could be a lot smoother if we had dedicated, reusable components for each language, for example:

```jsx
<LangTabs>
  <LangTab lang="rust">...</LangTab>
  <LangTab lang="go">...</LangTab>
  ...etc
</LangTabs>
```

Or even...

```jsx
<LangTabs>
  <RustTab>...</RustTab>
  <GoTab>...</GoTab>
  ...etc
</LangTabs>
```

[See the issue for more information](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmcloud.com/issues/254).

## `wasmCloud/wasmcloud.com`: "Copy" button not working

Another good one for frontend folks: the copy button on our code blocks is bugged. 

[Check out the issue](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmcloud.com/issues/952) and help save users from all that Command/Ctrl+Cing.  

## `wasmCloud/go`: Create project documentation

Several directories in the `wasmCloud/go` repository are missing proper documentation. Much of it, such as READMEs for the `examples` and `templates` directories, don't require deep expertise in wasmCloud or Go, but they could definitely use some TLC. 

[See the issue for more information](https://github.com/wasmCloud/go/issues/151)!

## `wasmCloud/typescript`: Create project documentation

It's not just our Go ecosystem that could use some documentation help&mdash;the same is true over in our TypeScript repository, where we could use some help with READMEs and a contributing guide.

## Conclusion

As Brooks said in his [look forward at the project's next steps](/blog/2025-07-01-charting-the-next-steps-for-wasmcloud/index.mdx), the community is the pillar of wasmCloud, and we're always thrilled to welcome new contributors. If you have questions or just want to chat Wasm, make sure to [join the wasmCloud Slack](https://slack.wasmcloud.com/) and tune in to the next [wasmCloud community meeting](/community/). Hope to see you there!
